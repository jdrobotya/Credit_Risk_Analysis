# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to predict a credit card risk by applying machine learning skills. Different techniques will be employed  to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. A credit card data set from LendingClub will be used  to predict if the client is likely to have high or low credit risk.  

## Results: 
There were six machine learning models applied  while working on this module. Below you can see the balanced accuracy scores, precision and recall scores  for each of  models: 

1)Naive Random Oversampling:
